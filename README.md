## Architecture

Two repositories work together:

| Repo | Role |
|------|------|
| `globalinvesting-engine` (private) | Python scripts and GitHub Actions that fetch, process, and write JSON data files to this repo on schedule |
| `forexpulse.github.io` (this repo) | Static HTML/CSS/JS terminal + JSON data files served via GitHub Pages |

The frontend reads all data via `fetch()` from JSON files committed to this repo. No API keys are exposed in the client. TradingView widgets provide live charting, heatmap, economic calendar, and economic map without requiring any API key.
